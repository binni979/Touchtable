# Touch-Table-Visualization
## Project overview:
This file describes the requirements for developing a web application that displays a map of the United States divided into four map instances. Each map instance should be independent of the other (while we clicked on one map instance, the other map instances should not be changed). Also, the application should provide an option for each user to choose what data to display on the map from Veda data. The application should support multi-touch.
